"Global urban vegetation exhibits divergent thermal effects: from cooling to warming as aridity increases"

ðŸ“– Overview
This study provides the first global assessment of the Temperature Regulation Capability (TRC) of urban vegetation across 761 megacities. We combine high-resolution satellite data, machine learning, and a process-based biophysical model to uncover a critical divergence: while urban vegetation generally cools cities, it can cause net warming in arid regions (22% of cities) due to a trade-off between limited evapotranspiration cooling and albedo-induced radiative warming.

Key Findings
Spatial Divergence: Urban grassland and cropland cause net warming in 22% of cities, predominantly in arid regions (<1000 mm annual precipitation).
Extreme Heat Response: During extreme heat, trees fail to cool 25% of cities, while grasslands and croplands fail in 71% and 82% of cities, respectively.
Biophysical Drivers: The warming effect is driven by lower albedo and reduced heat storage in vegetation outweighing limited evapotranspiration in arid environments.
Policy Implication: Urban greening must be climate-adaptive; in arid cities, high-albedo surfaces may be more effective than non-tree vegetation.
